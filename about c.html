    <h1>About C Language</h1>
    <p>The C programming language is a powerful, efficient, and widely used language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, particularly for system and application software.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of C</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> C is known for its performance and efficiency, making it ideal for system-level programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> C code can be compiled and run on many different types of computers with minimal changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> C provides low-level access to memory and hardware, allowing for fine-grained control over system resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Library:</strong> C has a rich set of built-in functions and libraries that make development faster and easier.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications of C</h2>
    <p>C is used in a wide range of applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operating Systems (e.g., Unix, Linux, Windows)</li>
        <li>Embedded Systems</li>
        <li>Compilers and Interpreters</li>
        <li>Database Management Systems</li>
        <li>Game Development</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>C remains a foundational language in computer science and software engineering. Its influence can be seen in many modern programming languages, and it continues to be a valuable tool for developers around the world.</p>
